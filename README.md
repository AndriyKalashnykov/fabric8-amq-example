fabric8-amq-example
======================

An example on how to get an OSGi service (SCR) acting both as JMS producer and consumer. In Fabric8, of course ;-)
Also - and it was the worst part of doing this - includes integration tests with Fabric8/Pax-Exam 2.x integration.

# Pre-requisites

* JDK 7
* Maven 3.1.0 or newer

# Build and test

```
mvn -U clean install
```
